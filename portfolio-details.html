              <li><strong>Destination</strong>:London</li>

            <p>
              My name is Vinay and I am a Software Engineer attending British Telecom in London, United Kingdom .I am
              striving to create a career in the Software Sectore - allowing me to combine my love of customer service
              with my passion for travel and international relations. My work has provided me with the most incredible
              opportunity to put my dream into action and learn from some incredibly knowledgeable individuals, whilst
              discovering England's Capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              London has always intrigued me. Its combination of historical charm and industrial power makes it a city
              unlike any other, which made it the perfect destination. I never could have dreamed of falling in love
              with a city the way that I have with London. Since the moment I touched down at HeathRow Airport after a
              long and lonely red-eye flight, I haven't been able to shake the feeling of pure admiration and
              excitement.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always known that I thrive in large, challenging environments and London has provided me with the
              opportunity to be a "small fish in a big pond". With more to discover and conquer than anyone could ever
              dream of accomplishing, I find myself learning and discovering constantly and my love for this city
              continues to grow with every day that I spend here.
              London is one of the best cities in the world for so many reasons. My personal favourite aspect of this
              thriving city is that you are never more than five steps away from coffee. Food is a culture all of its
              own here and each meal is a full event. From England's signature 'High Tea', composed of mini sandwiches,
              exquisite desserts and an endless supply of bubbly, to truly delicious greasy street food found on every
              corner â€¦ if you are passionate about food like I am, London will not let you down. Grabbing drinks after
              work is equally as natural to Londoners, and the countless rooftop restaurants and bars are the perfect
              destination to catch up with friends, while overlooking the bustling city. Additionally, London's
              transportation system is unrivalled. The complex interrelation of the Underground (Tube) System, the
              Overground Trains and the frequent busses makes it surprisingly easy to navigate and they can get you
              anywhere and everywhere in the city, through the simple "tap" of your Oyster card. Further, London is an
              urban forest, where green spaces make up nearly 50% of the metropolitan area. Parks, gardens, fields of
              flowers, playgrounds and school yards are prevalent and make for magical picnics, refreshing walks or
              peaceful getaways from the bustle of the city. Many green spaces, however, are much more than open spaces
              - for example, Hyde Park, London's most famous green area, offers a wide variety of activities (biking,
              horseback riding, paddle boating etc.) and hosts dozens of events year round.
              London is so much more than the home of the Royal Family and the center for historical landmarks. There is
              simply so much going on that it is impossible to know it all, and that is what makes London truly
              mysteriously charming. You will never discover it all or know it all.
              London has given me the push that I didn't know I needed and I can't wait to continue exploring and
              learning about this magnificent city. I am already picking up the English "slang" and humour, and hope
              that my remaining two months lead me to develop a British accent!
